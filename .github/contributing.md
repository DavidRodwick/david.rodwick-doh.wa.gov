# Contributing guide

These guidelines set expectations for how we collaborate on this repository. This is a template repository for GitHub Basics exercises. This repository is WIP and will be used to facilitate training development until it is ready to release as a template repository for training purposes. Collaborators should refer to the following guidelines and resources before contributing to this repository.

### General Scope
Staff that complete this training should be able to use GitHub at a basic level when collaborating. GitHub Basics will focus on:

- WADOH GitHub enterprise conditions of use
- Properly setting up an account
- Familiarizing with **GitHub's web interface**
- An introduction to the GitHub workflow
- How to communicate on the platform
- How to retrieve files from existing GitHub repositories

Basics will _not_ touch on specific development environments (like RStudio); it should be language- and platform-agnostic. This training will be used by non-developers, stakeholders, supervisors, and other users with light or irregular use of GitHub.

### Time Committment
Github Basics is designed to be completed in 2-4 hours.

## Contribute towards an Issue

- Assign yourself to the issue; Coordinate with any other assignees!
- Create an issue branch if one hasn't been created already; [Creating issue branches - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue)
- Make your changes on your issue branch; communicate as needed in the Issue thread
- Submit a pull request when the Issue has been resolved with your changes; update your branch from the main branch as needed
- Assign DOH-SRE1303 as a reviewer

## Contribute a new idea

- Create a new branch from `main`, etc.
- Make your changes on this branch
- Submit a pull request
- Assign DOH-SRE1303 as a reviewer

## Notes
This training should be language agnostic â€” i.e. R, Python, SAS users, etc. should be able to complete this training and apply it to their own work environments.
